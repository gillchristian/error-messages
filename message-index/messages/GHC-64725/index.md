title: User-defined type error
summary: An invalid constraint or type family reduces to a custom type error.
introduced: 9.6.1
severity: error
---

Errors like this usually come from libraries trying to enforce certain
rules about the types they work with, or to improve upon a compiler error that
would occur otherwise. It is up to the library authors to provide enough
information in the embedded error message to fix the failing programâ€”check
the documentation for the function that triggered the error for more
information.
These errors are constructed using `GHC.TypeLits.TypeError` applied to a type
level error message as the context of a class instance, and the compiler
will show them when a program attempts to use such an instance.
